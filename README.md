# Prime Directive

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to illustrate both custom directives and custom validators in Angular

The current version supported is Angular 7.1.

## What It Does

It creates a simple application that:

- Uses the Angular Material controls
- Allows only numbers to be entered into the input by creating `NumbersOnlyDirective` which allows only numbers to be typed, pasted, and dragged to the input control
- Validates that the number entered is a prime number using `NumbersValidator.isPrimeNumber()` as a validator in the Form Group.
